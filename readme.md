To learn threeJS I made this music visualiser. ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽ¶ 

## Geometry
For the blob I started from [this tutorial](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@clayjohn/learning-3d-graphics-with-three-js-or-dynamic-geometry) and did some adjustments so it reacts to an audio analyser. 

## Shader
I based the shader on [this Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llcXW7) from [K_mouse](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/k_mouse) and did some tweaks so it would fit my needs. 

## Music
I used this song, by WU-tang clan, for this demo. I do not own the rights to this song. If you have an issue with me using this song or picture please contact me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/designed_by_lars/).
